# :partly_sunny: Weather Application

Individual project/challenge given to me by [BeCode](https://github.com/becodeorg). 

I have build a weather application to display the weather of any given city.
The user enters a city of his/her choice and the weather for the next 5 days will display.
The goal of this project was to learn AJAX and work with an API.
